# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Chronological Event Timeline**: The LLM processor now acts as a "Time Detective," actively extracting the true publish/event time from raw article content. The UI Dashboard now sorts intelligence primarily by this `event_timestamp` rather than the system scraping time.
- **Dynamic Noise Deduplication**: Introduced a zero-cost Python `difflib` similarity engine for the Agentic Scraper. If a website's snapshot changes by < 5% (e.g., ticking clocks, ad rotations), it is immediately discarded to prevent LLM hallucination duplicates. RSS feeds now also feature dual-layer URL and Title exact-match deduplication.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Global i18n Support**: Introduced a robust multi-language architecture supporting English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian.
- **Smart Language Sniffing**: The backend now automatically reads the browser's `Accept-Language` HTTP header to seamlessly render the correct local language without page reload flashes.
- **Supabase-Style UI**: A completely redesigned, ultra-minimalist `64px` persistent sidebar using native Streamlit routing and CSS overriding. 
- **Agentic Scraper (Tier 3)**: Integrated a Playwright-based headless browser to defeat advanced JavaScript rendering and anti-bot systems.
- **LLM Cost Auditing**: A built-in Dashboard to track all local token usage (differentiating Gemini Flash and Pro) and estimate costs based on real-time API pricing.
- **Automated Daily Briefing**: Scheduled synthesis of global intelligence using Gemini 1.5 Pro to connect the dots across 24 hours of data.

### Security
- Shifted all frontend JS-based parameter injections to secure backend native parsing to completely resolve cross-origin iframe sandbox `SecurityError` vulnerabilities.
